# Single Price Auction
Single Price Auction is a pricing method that provides in a single price. Unlike Multi Price Auction, this method makes consumers and producers to trade the goods at a single price. 

## How to set the price

As you can see, we align each one's bidding price on a same graph.

The Intersection point A stands for equilibrium price, and every trade on this Single price auction is traded on the price of point A. The price of bidders on the left would be dragged to the point A, so that they can trade on a single price, while the price of bidders on the right side will be declined. 

## Advantage of single price auction

The very advantage of single price auction is that every consumer and producer on this trade can derive benefit.
As you can figure out on the graph, if bidders are on the left side of point A, consumers can buy goods cheaper than they expected, while the producers can provide goods in a more expensive price than they expected. 
However, in case of the right side of the graph, since consumers are trying to buy goods cheaper than the equilibrium price and producers are trying to sell goods more expensive than the equilibrium price, the deals will be declined. 

By doing this, every participants of this deal can berive benefits.
